# Quick-sort
Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that picks a pivot element, partitions the array into elements less than and greater than the pivot, and recursively sorts the partitions. It’s efficient with average time complexity O(n log n), but worst-case is O(n²). It’s fast and widely used for in-place sorting.
